                            <p>The MMYC Ambassadors are composed of ambitious youth that help promote not only MMYC
                                events, but MMYCâ€™s values of community involvement and leadership as well. In previous
                                years, the Ambassadors have taken on different initiatives
                                to promote awareness for youth issues. Apart from developing leadership skills, joining
                                the Ambassadors is an opportunity to better understand how MMYC operates and have your
                                voice heard within the Markham youth community.</p>
